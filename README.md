## Linear Regression 

This repository demonstrates the **implementation of Linear Regression using the Scikit-Learn library**.  
Linear Regression is a fundamental supervised machine learning algorithm used for predicting **continuous numerical values**.

At present, **Linear Regression is the only implemented algorithm**, with a focus on correct usage, clear workflow, and proper evaluation.

##  What Is Linear Regression?

**Linear Regression** models the relationship between input features (X) and a target variable (y) by fitting a linear equation to observed data.

The general form of Linear Regression is ::
y = mx + b

Where:
- `x` → input feature(s)
- `m` → coefficient (slope)
- `b` → intercept
- `y` → predicted output

The goal is to learn the best values of `m` and `b` that minimize prediction error.
